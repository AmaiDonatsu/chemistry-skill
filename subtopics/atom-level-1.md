# Atom Level 1

### Reflection 
```
Historically, the term atom (from the Greek a-tomos, ‘undivided’) was a prophecy that modern physics believed it had refuted by discovering the subatomic world. However, in a profound and structural sense, the atom remains the indivisible unit of elementary reality. Although we can break it down into quarks and leptons, in that act of breaking we sacrifice identity. The atom is the final frontier of essence: it is the smallest piece of architecture that cannot be broken down without the element itself ceasing to exist or changing radically.

## The Chemical Reaction 
A chemical reaction is a process in which two or more atoms bond to form a new compound. 
The core of a chemical reaction is the difference and accounting of charges. The type of reaction and its intensity depend on how the nucleus of an atom is attracted to the electrons of a neighboring atom.

## The Nucleus
Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of the atom. The number of protons defines the atomic number and defines the element itself, but why are protons specifically what define the element? Each of the particles in the atom is very important in the behavior of the atom. Any change in any particle of the atom makes the element different in some way. One way to look at it is this: the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive charge and, by nature, repel each other strongly. To stay together, the protons have neutrons between them. Neutrons have a neutral charge, so they do not repel each other, acting as an insulator between protons. Furthermore, it is the strong nuclear force, the strongest of all fundamental forces, that holds the entire nucleus together, but it only acts at very short distances. On the other hand, electrons are smaller particles than the particles in the nucleus. Atoms can easily lose and gain electrons depending on the element. They can lose electrons, and if a force is applied to them, their electrons can move and rise or fall in energy levels. The electron configuration is more “malleable” than the nucleus. Electrons have a negative charge, so the number of protons (positive charge) defines how many electrons (negative charge) there will be and how they will be configured. Protons define the electron configuration and not vice versa because the nucleus is much more fixed, more static, and very difficult to change without a nuclear reaction or an extreme release of energy due to the strong nuclear force. Electrons are more “free” than the nucleus, which is why the number of protons (which is a more fixed property) defines the configuration of electrons (a more negotiable property).

In more technical terms:
The proton's sovereignty over the atom's identity is not accidental; it is a consequence of thermodynamic stability. While the electron cloud is a negotiable and dynamic environment—where particles can be given up, gained, or shared to form bonds—the nucleus is a static fortress. Protected by the strong nuclear force and stabilized by the presence of neutrons (which act as mediators in the face of electrical repulsion), protons define the atomic number ($Z$). Because the energy required to alter the nucleus is orders of magnitude greater than conventional chemical energy, the proton becomes the constant that defines the element. The electron proposes the reaction, but the proton determines the identity.
