# Atom Level 1

### Reflection 
``` 
Historically, the term atom (from the Greek a-tomos, ‘undivided’) was a prophecy that modern physics believed it had refuted by discovering the subatomic world. However, in a profound and structural sense, the atom remains the indivisible unit of elementary reality. Although we can break it down into quarks and leptons, in that act of breaking we sacrifice identity. The atom is the final frontier of essence: it is the smallest piece of architecture that cannot be broken down without the element itself ceasing to exist or changing radically.

## The Chemical Reaction 
A chemical reaction is a process in which two or more atoms bond to form a new compound. 
The core of a chemical reaction is the difference and accounting of charges. The type of reaction and its intensity depend on how the nucleus of an atom is attracted to the electrons of a neighboring atom.
