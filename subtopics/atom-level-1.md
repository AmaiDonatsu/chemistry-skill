# Atom Level 1

### Reflection 
```
Historically, the term atom (from the Greek a-tomos, ‘undivided’) was a prophecy that modern physics believed it had refuted by discovering the subatomic world. However, in a profound and structural sense, the atom remains the indivisible unit of elementary reality. Although we can break it down into quarks and leptons, in that act of breaking we sacrifice identity. The atom is the final frontier of essence: it is the smallest piece of architecture that cannot be broken down without the element itself ceasing to exist or changing radically.

## The Chemical Reaction 
A chemical reaction is a process in which two or more atoms bond to form a new compound. 
The core of a chemical reaction is the difference and accounting of charges. The type of reaction and its intensity depend on how the nucleus of an atom is attracted to the electrons of a neighboring atom.

## The Nucleus
Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of the atom. The number of protons defines the atomic number and defines the element itself, but why are protons specifically what define the element? Each of the particles in the atom is very important in the behavior of the atom. Any change in any particle of the atom makes the element different in some way. One way to look at it is this: the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive charge and, by nature, repel each other strongly. To stay together, the protons have neutrons between them. Neutrons have a neutral charge, so they do not repel each other, acting as an insulator between protons. Furthermore, it is the strong nuclear force, the strongest of all fundamental forces, that holds the entire nucleus together, but it only acts at very short distances. On the other hand, electrons are smaller particles than the particles in the nucleus. Atoms can easily lose and gain electrons depending on the element. They can lose electrons, and if a force is applied to them, their electrons can move and rise or fall in energy levels. The electron configuration is more “malleable” than the nucleus. Electrons have a negative charge, so the number of protons (positive charge) defines how many electrons (negative charge) there will be and how they will be configured. Protons define the electron configuration and not vice versa because the nucleus is much more fixed, more static, and very difficult to change without a nuclear reaction or an extreme release of energy due to the strong nuclear force. Electrons are more “free” than the nucleus, which is why the number of protons (which is a more fixed property) defines the configuration of electrons (a more negotiable property).

In more technical terms:
The proton's sovereignty over the atom's identity is not accidental; it is a consequence of thermodynamic stability. While the electron cloud is a negotiable and dynamic environment—where particles can be given up, gained, or shared to form bonds—the nucleus is a static fortress. Protected by the strong nuclear force and stabilized by the presence of neutrons (which act as mediators in the face of electrical repulsion), protons define the atomic number ($Z$). Because the energy required to alter the nucleus is orders of magnitude greater than conventional chemical energy, the proton becomes the constant that defines the element. The electron proposes the reaction, but the proton determines the identity.

## Electron
The electron is a negatively charged particle with less mass and a smaller radius than the proton. Unlike the particles in the nucleus, the electron is not composed of other particles; it is a fundamental subatomic particle. The electron configuration defines the reactivity of the element, that is, the propensity of the element to form bonds with other elements.

## Historical "chain of thought" leading to the discovery of the atom

About 400 years before our era, a philosopher named Democritus proposed a thought experiment:
take a piece of matter, divide it in two, cut that half in half again, and repeat the process. Could you do this infinitely? Democritus considered it impossible and concluded that if you divided a piece of matter infinitely, at some point you would arrive at nothingness, as if the basic “particle” of everything were nothingness, and structures could not be built from nothingness.

The idea of infinitely divisible matter creates a problem. If all matter is created from four substances in different proportions, and matter can be divided infinitely, then the proportions would be infinite, which means there would be an infinity of different materials, and there would be no way to classify them clearly. However, it seems that materials are more deterministic. Objects made of the same material have similar characteristics. All rocks have the same texture, all gold coins have the same color, and when struck, they make the same sound. All silver coins can be identified as authentic or counterfeit by measuring the same characteristics. This tells us that there must be certain specific substances that are made of “indivisible” parts which, when combined with others in specific parts according to some rule, form the materials with the characteristics we know.

Another argument put forward by Democritus was that if matter throughout the world were infinitely divisible, it would be impossible for it to sustain itself; at some point, everything would dissolve into infinite fragments.

Philosophical ideas, like scientific ideas, arise from problems posed by previous or contemporary ideas. The philosopher Thales proposed that the fundamental principle of nature was water in order to explain the solid and dry nature of liquids. Heraclitus proposed fire as the solution to the problem of constant change, arguing that, like fire, everything is a process, nothing is a “thing” or an object, everything is a process that is happening, and the “thing” is a moment in time within that process. 

Parmenides proposed *Being* in a way that denied change.
Delving deeper into Parmenides' “being,” *being* is one, *non-being* does not exist, because it is impossible to think of nothingness, and nothingness cannot exist; nothingness cannot change and cannot go from *non-being* to *being*. Therefore, *being* is immutable, it has always existed and will always exist, thinking of change as an illusion.
Democritus' idea was fundamental, comparing them all, perhaps Democritus' idea is the most complete, and in some way makes the previous ideas work, the properties of different materials, such as being solid, being liquid, being air, being hard, having a color, a taste, a smell, or a sound, were due to the small characteristics of the atoms that composed them and the combination of these atoms. For constant change, he adds the void to his idea of the atom, unlike the idea of *being* that *non-being* could not exist. Democritus gives the void a role as a medium through which the atom moves and changes; constant change is explained by the movement of atoms within the void.


But at the same time, the idea of *being* continues to function: the change in materials and their characteristics is due to the atom in a vacuum. but, thinking of the atom as an indivisible and eternal piece, as something that is never destroyed but rather organized, in the end everything remains the same. Trees, rocks, and soil are made of the same eternal atoms that have always existed, and even if the rock is destroyed and the tree dies, their atoms will continue to exist and will organize themselves differently to form new materials.

```The only things that exist are atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.```
 
Taking a historic leap forward in the early 19th century, John Dalton realized that, in the laboratory, elements always changed in whole number proportions, 1 part of A to 2 parts of B, but never 1.45 parts.
