# Introduction
It is the simplest and most abundant element, representing 75% of the observable matter in the universe. In 1776, English chemist Henry Cavendish identified it as “inflammable air,” and in 1811, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier named it “hydrogen.” The name hydrogen comes from the Greek “hydrogenos,” which means “water former,” because they realized that when it burned, that is, when it reacted with oxygen, it formed water.
This reaction is easily achieved in the laboratory by reacting a metal such as aluminum with an acid such as hydrochloric acid. This reaction creates a metal salt, aluminum chloride, and pure hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas does not react on its own with air, but when energy is applied, such as heat or a spark, it will begin to react with the oxygen in the air, forming water and releasing heat violently. When a piece of glass is placed over the flame produced, small drops of water can be seen condensing.
