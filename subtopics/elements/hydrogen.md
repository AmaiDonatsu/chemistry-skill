# Introduction
It is the simplest and most abundant element, representing 75% of the observable matter in the universe. In 1776, English chemist Henry Cavendish identified it as “inflammable air,” and in 1811, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier named it “hydrogen.” The name hydrogen comes from the Greek “hydrogenos,” which means “water former,” because they realized that when it burned, that is, when it reacted with oxygen, it formed water.
This reaction is easily achieved in the laboratory by reacting a metal such as aluminum with an acid such as hydrochloric acid. This reaction creates a metal salt, aluminum chloride, and pure hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas does not react on its own with air, but when energy is applied, such as heat or a spark, it will begin to react with the oxygen in the air, forming water and releasing heat violently. When a piece of glass is placed over the flame produced, small drops of water can be seen condensing.

### Properties
The hydrogen atom is the lightest and simplest atom, consisting of a single electron orbiting a proton. It is the most stable and well-known form of hydrogen, called protium. 
However, there are other types of stable hydrogen where what changes is the composition of the atomic nucleus, specifically the number of neutrons it has, which we know as isotopes. The second most stable isotope of hydrogen is deuterium, where there is also a neutron in the nucleus. There are many deuterium compounds, such as deuterated water or heavy water, which has two deuterium atoms instead of two protium atoms.
The third most common isotope is tritium, with two neutrons in the nucleus. It is less stable and will attempt to return to stability by decaying, which is known as a radioactive isotope.
It is speculated that deuterium and tritium will be the fuels for future nuclear reactors, nuclear fusion reactors, which promise to create clean energy by fusing deuterium and tritium, as occurs in stars, producing helium as a waste product.
