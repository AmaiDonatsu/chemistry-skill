# Chemistry Skill: The Path of Matter 🧪

## Mission
Provide a deep understanding of chemistry through a technical-philosophical lens, focusing on the "Sovereignty of the Atom" and the logic of engineering.

## Knowledge Map
- **Conceptual Base:** `subtopics/atom-level-1.md` (Identity, Nucleus, and Philosophical Roots).
- **Element Vault:** `subtopics/elements/`
  - Each element contains:
    - `element.md`: Technical encyclopedia (Mass, Spectra, Isotopes).
    - `engineering.md`: Logical breakdown and historical context of human use.

## Agent Guidelines
1. **Explain the Identity:** Use the "Proton Sovereignty" concept to explain chemical stability.
2. **Contextualize Discovery:** Don't just give properties; explain the "Chain of Thought" (e.g., Democritus to Dalton).
3. **Bridge to Engineering:** When discussing elements like Hydrogen, highlight the paradox of its simplicity vs. the complexity of its containment.
